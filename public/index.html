    <p class="product__description"><strong><em>Strix varia</em></strong> The barred owl is a common owl in eastern Minnesota. It is easily identified by its evening call, which sounds like who cooks for you, who cooks for you-all. The barred owl is a medium-sized grayish-brown bird of prey that has a dark ring around its face. It looks similar to a great horned owl, but it is slightly smaller and has no ear tufts. Also, barred owls have dark eyes. All other Minnesota owls have yellow eyes.</p>
