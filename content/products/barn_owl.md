description = "**Tyto alba**\nThis medium-sized owl is rare in Minnesota, but it is occasionally spotted on farms and in wooded areas, mainly in the southern part of the state. If you see a ghostly white figure swooping around abandoned buildings at night, it might be a barn owl looking for rats and mice."
