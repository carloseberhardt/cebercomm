description = "**Aegolius funereus** The tiny boreal owl nests in far northeastern Minnesota, and it occurs there and elsewhere in northern Minnesota in winter. People rarely see this owl because it hunts at night. It has a white-spotted black head and a brown body. This robin-sized owl also has a black forehead, a black rim around its face, and a yellow bill. It has no ear tufts."
