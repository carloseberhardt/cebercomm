description = "**_Athene cunicularia, Speotyto cunicularia_** The burrowing owl is a small, 23-29 cm (9-11 in.) high, light brown owl whose most distinctive features include its long legs, short tail, and lack of ear tufts. It is most often seen perched on the ground or atop a small raised mound or fencepost. The species bobs up and down when agitated and will usually dive into its burrow rather than take flight when approached too closely."
